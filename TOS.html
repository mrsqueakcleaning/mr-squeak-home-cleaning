            <h3>11. Third-Party Entities</h3>
            <p>We're not responsible for third-party content linked to our Services. Their terms govern their services, not ours. Mr. Squeak does not endorse third-party products or services and assumes no liability for damages caused by their use.</p>

            <p>Our Services are provided "as is" without guarantees. We aim for a good experience but can't ensure perfection in all aspects.</p>

            <h3>15. Limitation of Liability</h3>

            <h3>16. Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <h4>A. Small Claims Court</h4>
            <p>We can each bring claims to small claims court.</p>

            <h4>B. Arbitration</h4>
            <p>Disputes not suitable for small claims will go to binding arbitration in accordance with New York law, except for intellectual property disputes seeking equitable relief.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arbitration Rules:</strong> Governed by the AAA under the Federal Arbitration Act.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-appearance Arbitration:</strong> For claims under $25,000, can be done remotely.</li>
                <li><strong>Arbitration Fees:</strong> We cover fees beyond a reasonable estimate if you can't afford them; otherwise, each party pays their own legal fees unless otherwise awarded by the arbitrator.</li>
                <li><strong>Arbitrator's Authority:</strong> Broad but individual, no class actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Opt Out:</strong> You have 60 days to opt out of arbitration.</li>
                <li><strong>Waiver of Jury Trial:</strong> Both parties waive jury trials for arbitration disputes.</li>
                <li><strong>Waiver of Class Actions:</strong> Claims must be individual, not class-based.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>C. Exclusive Venue</h4>
            <p>For court cases, New York State has jurisdiction.</p>

            <h3>17. Choice of Law</h3>
            <p>New York law applies to these Terms.</p>

            <h3>18. Severability</h3>
            <p>If any part hereof is invalid, the rest remains enforceable.</p>

            <h3>19. Additional Terms for Specific Services</h3>
            <p>We might have additional terms for specific services. If they conflict with these Terms, the specific terms apply.</p>

            <h3>20. Refund Policy</h3>
            <p>We generally do not provide refunds but strive to resolve issues through our Squeak Guarantee. If you believe a refund is warranted, contact us within 48 hours of the Initial Clean with an explanation.</p>
            <p>Separate written agreements with different refund policies take precedence.</p>

            <h3>21. Solicitation of Our Cleaners and Employment Practices</h3>
            <p>Hiring or soliciting our cleaners within 24 months from their employment with us or engaging in side deals up to 18 months after your last service with us incurs a $25,000 fee. You must report any such attempts. Violating this leads to added legal fees. Exchanging contact details is considered a breach.</p>

            <h3>22. Client Responsibilities</h3>

                <li>Clearly indicate fragile items or areas requiring special attention.</li>
                <li>Ensure the property is in a condition suitable for cleaning as per our standards.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>24. Recurring Services Policy</h3>
            <p>Recurring clients may enjoy loyalty discounts and priority scheduling.</p>
            <p>Cancellation terms for recurring services remain as outlined in the Cancellation Policy, but we offer flexibility for long-term clients facing unforeseen circumstances.</p>

            <h3>25. Training Standards</h3>
            <p>Our staff undergoes rigorous training, including certifications in cleaning techniques, safety protocols, and customer service. We are committed to ongoing education to maintain service excellence.</p>

            <h3>26. Client Feedback and Reviews</h3>
